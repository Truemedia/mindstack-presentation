      <h2>Why is a <span class="key-detail">new</span> framework solution needed?</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>MARKUP</dt>
        <dd>
          Speech assistants like <span class="service service--alexa">Alexa</span> use <span class="key-detail">SSML</span> with some custom tags where as text chat services like <span class="service service--slack">Slack</span> use custom <span class="key-detail">markdown</span>. There isn't any library currently to write a template that works for all and very few bot frameworks use templating libraries.
        </dd>
        <dt>SERVICE API'S</dt>
        <dd>
          There is <span class="key-issue">no consolidated API</span> for the services I want to use. Why write code more than once when it's doing the same thing on a different services?
        </dd>
        <dt>UNINTELLIGENT</dt>
        <dd>
          Most chat bot architectures are still using conventions which are <span class="key-issue">outdated and clunky</span>, where as people want <span class="key-detail">natural conversations</span> with smart AI. Even voice assistants are lacking in terms of the leg work needed to recognise a wide spectrum of conversation scenarios which people would want to essentially to perform the same task.
        </dd>
        <dt>LACK OF PERSONALITY</dt>
        <dd>
          It's nice to have a conversation with something that seems somewhat <span class="key-detail">intelligent</span> and has a <span class="key-detail">personality</span> you can connect with on a personal level. <span class="key-issue">Generic and stale language</span> can make the experience boring and feel like a chore more than a nice thing to have.
        </dd>
        <dt>STRUCTURE</dt>
        <dd>
          Most framework or api options leave very little in terms of ideas on how to structure your application. <span class="key-issue">Improvising</span> in this area can be daunting and quickly come back to bite you if you opt for the wrong strategy which essentially becomes a game of luckily fishing for useful libraries to get one thing done in the only way you can think how.
        </dd>
        <dt>AMOUNT OF CODE</dt>
        <dd>
          To make any kind of skill with a reasonable amount of functionality and great user experience for multiple api's without a framework would be a massively daunting and time consuming experience. Why would you want that when <span class="key-detail">boilerplate</span> can save you from <span class="key-issue">spaghetti code</span> and hours of your life back?
